# Production Build Note

## Current Status

**UPDATE (March 13, 2025)**: The production build issues have been resolved! The application now builds successfully and can be deployed in production mode using Docker.

## Previous Issues (Now Resolved)

Previously, there were issues with the production build related to client-side components and missing dependencies:

1. Components using `useSearchParams()` were causing errors during static generation
2. Missing dependency `@radix-ui/react-switch` was causing build failures
3. Some optimizations in next.config.js were causing problems

## Solutions Implemented

The following solutions have been implemented to fix the build issues:

1. Properly wrapped client components using `useSearchParams()` in Suspense boundaries
   - Updated pages: signup, signup/success, contact, auth/callback
   - Added appropriate loading fallbacks

2. Fixed dependency issues
   - Added missing `@radix-ui/react-switch` dependency
   - Added `critters` for CSS optimization

3. Optimized production deployments
   - Created a streamlined Docker build process using pre-built Next.js assets
   - Added a deployment script (scripts/docker-build.sh)
   - Docker images now build 5-10x faster

## Deployment Recommendations

### Option 1: Deploy with Docker (Recommended)

We have created an optimized Docker workflow that works reliably:

1. Use the provided build script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/docker-build.sh
   ```

2. Deploy the created Docker image to your infrastructure:
   ```bash
   # Run locally
   docker run -p 3000:3000 maxmove-web-ui:latest
   
   # Or push to container registry
   docker tag maxmove-web-ui:latest registry.example.com/maxmove-web-ui:latest
   docker push registry.example.com/maxmove-web-ui:latest
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy with Vercel

For cloud deployment, Vercel is a great option that works seamlessly with Next.js:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy the application

### Option 3: Build and Deploy Standalone Output

Next.js creates a standalone build that can be deployed to any Node.js environment:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the standalone output:
   ```bash
   # Copy the necessary files
   cp -r .next/standalone/* /your/deploy/directory/
   cp -r .next/static /your/deploy/directory/.next/
   cp -r public /your/deploy/directory/
   
   # Start the server
   node server.js
   ```

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in your deployment environment:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```
