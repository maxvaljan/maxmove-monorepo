# Production Build Note

## Current Status

The Next.js application is fully functional in development mode, but there are currently issues with the production build related to error pages (404/500).

## Issue Description

When running `npm run build`, Next.js attempts to generate static error pages, which is causing an error with the following message:

```
Error: Minified React error #31; visit https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html?invariant=31&args[]=object%20with%20keys%20%7B%24%24typeof%2C%20type%2C%20key%2C%20ref%2C%20props%7D
Error occurred prerendering page "/404".
```

This is a common issue with Next.js, particularly when using certain components or libraries that aren't fully compatible with Static Site Generation (SSG).

## Recommended Workarounds

There are several approaches that can be used to work around this issue:

### Option 1: Deploy with Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel has better handling for error pages and can deploy the application even with these build issues:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy the application
4. Vercel will handle error pages appropriately at runtime

### Option 2: Deploy in Development Mode (Temporary)

For temporary deployments or testing:

1. Build a Docker image with development mode:
   ```
   # Dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN npm install
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
   ```

2. Deploy this image to your infrastructure

### Option 3: Use Server-Side Only Mode

Modify the Next.js configuration to avoid static generation completely:

1. Update `next.config.js`:
   ```js
   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
   const nextConfig = {
     reactStrictMode: true,
     // Avoid static generation for error pages
     experimental: {
       serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['*'],
     },
   };

   module.exports = nextConfig;
   ```

2. This will ensure all pages, including error pages, are rendered server-side

## Next Steps for Fixing

The development team is exploring the following approaches for a permanent fix:

1. Investigate the specific component causing the static generation error
2. Consider refactoring error pages to use simpler components
3. Update to the latest version of Next.js when available
4. Submit an issue to the Next.js repository if the problem persists

## For Now

For the time being, the application should be used in development mode (`npm run dev`) while we work on resolving the production build issue. This will not affect functionality, but only the deployment method.
