# Next.js Migration Notes

## Migration Status

The migration from Vite to Next.js is nearly complete. Here's the current status:

### Completed
- âœ… All components ported from Vite to Next.js
- âœ… API routes implemented 
- âœ… Authentication flow working
- âœ… Styling and CSS migration
- âœ… Fixed TypeScript type issues

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Production build issues (404/500 page errors) - See PRODUCTION_BUILD.md for details and workarounds
- âœ… Final testing of all routes and components - Completed and documented in TEST_RESULTS.md

### Pending
- âœ… Development deployment configuration - Created Dockerfile.dev and start-dev-container.sh
- ðŸ”„ Production deployment configuration - Pending resolution of build issues

## Build Issues

There are still some issues with the production build related to error pages (404/500). These appear to be related to how Next.js handles static generation of error pages. For now, we're focusing on getting everything working properly in development mode. See PRODUCTION_BUILD.md for detailed information on the issue and workarounds.

## Testing

The application is fully functional in development mode. The following routes have been tested and are working correctly:

- Home page (/)
- About page (/about)
- Services page (/services)
- Business page (/business)
- Drivers page (/drivers)
- Investment page (/investment)
- Contact page (/contact)
- Sign In page (/signin)
- Sign Up page (/signup)
- Dashboard page (/dashboard)

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing all functionality in development mode
2. Resolve the production build errors (404/500 page issues)
3. Finalize deployment configuration
4. Make a full test deployment
5. Complete the migration by replacing web-ui with web-ui-next

## Notes on Implementation

- The application uses the App Router approach (app directory)
- Authentication is handled via Supabase Auth
- API routes are implemented as Route Handlers
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

## Known Issues

- Error pages (404/500) are causing issues during production build
- Some image optimizations may need further adjustment
- Need comprehensive testing with real user data

## Workarounds

For now, we're focusing on development mode and ensuring all functionality works correctly. The production build issues will be addressed in a subsequent phase.
