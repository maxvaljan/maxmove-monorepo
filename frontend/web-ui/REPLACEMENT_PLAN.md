# Plan for Replacing Vite with Next.js Implementation

This document outlines the steps to replace the existing Vite implementation with the new Next.js implementation.

## Pre-Replacement Checklist

- [x] All components migrated to Next.js
- [x] All API integrations functioning
- [x] Authentication flow working
- [x] Testing completed in development mode
- [x] Development deployment configuration ready
- [ ] Final stakeholder approval

## Replacement Approach

We'll use a phased approach to minimize risk and ensure a smooth transition:

### Phase 1: Parallel Deployment (Current)

- Keep both implementations running simultaneously
- The Vite implementation remains the production system
- The Next.js implementation runs in development mode for testing

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (1-2 days)

- Deploy the Next.js implementation using our development mode Docker setup
- Configure routing to send a small percentage (10-20%) of traffic to the Next.js implementation
- Monitor for any issues or unexpected behavior
- Be ready to route all traffic back to the Vite implementation if needed

### Phase 3: Full Replacement (2-3 days)

- Gradually increase traffic to the Next.js implementation (50% → 75% → 100%)
- Continue monitoring for issues
- Once 100% of traffic is on the Next.js implementation without issues for 24 hours, consider the replacement successful

### Phase 4: Post-Replacement (Ongoing)

- Decommission the Vite implementation
- Continue working on resolving the production build issues
- Once production build issues are resolved, transition from development mode to production mode deployment

## Execution Steps

1. **Prepare Infrastructure**
   - Set up the Docker environment for the Next.js implementation
   - Configure load balancing to support traffic splitting

2. **Deploy Next.js Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/maxmove-monorepo.git
   cd maxmove-monorepo
   
   # Deploy Next.js in development mode
   cd frontend/web-ui-next
   ./scripts/start-dev-container.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Traffic Routing**
   - Update load balancer/proxy settings to route initial percentage of traffic
   - Set up monitoring for both implementations

4. **Communication**
   - Inform all stakeholders about the migration timeline
   - Provide points of contact for reporting issues
   - Share monitoring dashboard links with relevant teams

5. **Monitoring**
   - Track key metrics:
     * Error rates
     * Response times
     * User engagement
     * Conversion rates
   - Set up alerts for any significant deviations

6. **Rollback Plan**
   In case of critical issues:
   - Immediately route 100% traffic back to Vite implementation
   - Analyze and fix issues in the Next.js implementation
   - Restart the phased approach once issues are resolved

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Start Date | End Date | Success Criteria |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|------------------|
| 1: Parallel | 1 week | [Current] | [Current+7d] | All testing completed |
| 2: Soft Launch | 2 days | [TBD] | [TBD+2d] | 20% traffic with metrics matching Vite |
| 3: Full Replacement | 3 days | [TBD] | [TBD+3d] | 100% traffic with no issues for 24h |
| 4: Post-Replacement | Ongoing | [TBD] | - | Vite decommissioned |

## Known Issues and Mitigation

- **Production Build Error**: Using development mode deployment until resolved
- **Performance in Development Mode**: Optimized Docker configuration for better performance
- **API Rate Limits**: Implemented caching to reduce API calls in development mode

## Sign-off Requirements

The following stakeholders must approve the migration before moving to Phase 3:

- [ ] Engineering Lead
- [ ] Product Manager
- [ ] QA Lead
- [ ] Operations Team
