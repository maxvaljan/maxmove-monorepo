## Known Issues

1. **Production Build Error**: There are issues with generating the 404 and 500 error pages during the production build. This needs to be fixed before deploying to production.

2. **API Integration**: The current implementation uses a mix of direct Supabase calls and API route calls. This should be standardized to use API routes exclusively for better maintainability.

3. **Image Optimization**: Some images may need further optimization for production.

## Next Steps

1. Fix production build error with error pages
2. Standardize API access method across components
3. Complete comprehensive testing with real user data
4. Configure deployment pipeline
5. Set up monitoring for the new implementation
